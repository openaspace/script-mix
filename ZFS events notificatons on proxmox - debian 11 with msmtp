################# SCRIPT ZFS-Notify Bash Script (zfs-notify.sh) ####################

#!/bin/bash
# This script is designed to send an email when an event occurs in a ZFS pool.
# It takes two arguments: the event that occurred, and the name of the pool in which it occurred.

event=$1  # The first argument, representing the event.
pool=$2  # The second argument, representing the name of the pool.

# Get the hostname of the system.
hostname=$(hostname)

# Construct the email subject, containing the event and hostname.
# Then, use msmtp to send the email.
# Replace "your_email@example.com" with the actual recipient's email.
echo "Subject: ZFS event: $event on $hostname" | msmtp --from=default -t your_email@example.com

################# ZFS-Start Bash Script (zfs-start.sh) #################     

#!/bin/bash
# This script is designed to continuously monitor a ZFS pool for events.
# It does this by running the "zpool events -f" command, which outputs events as they occur.
# The output from this command is piped into the zfs-notify.sh script.
# As a result, an email notification is sent for each event.
